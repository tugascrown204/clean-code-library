# Code Guidelines

## General Principles
- Write readable code: Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep functions small: Each function should do one thing and do it well.
- Avoid global variables: Limit the usage of global scope to prevent side effects.

## Language-Specific Guidelines
- ### Python
  - Follow PEP 8 coding standards.
  - Use list comprehensions and generator expressions for cleaner loops.
- ### Java
  - Follow Java Naming Conventions.
  - Make use of Java 8 features like Streams for cleaner data processing.
- ### TypeScript
  - Use interfaces to define object shapes.
  - Prefer `const` and `let` over `var` for variable declarations.
- ### JavaScript
  - Follow ES6 syntax for modern JavaScript code.
  - Use async/await for handling asynchronous operations.
